## My process
1. First I looked at the design images and then I try to create a basic HTML version out of it.
2. I then imported the JIT Compiler (Just in Time) with tailwind's pre script tag
3. Then it's the styling part, I learned how to read documentation and make my own styles.
4. Bug fixing is painful, but it's definity worth it. Meanwhile I fix my code, I took a break and then come back with an solution.

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to overlap / create a div block that covers the entire image

```html
<div class="relative cursor-pointer">
  <div class="absolute z-10 w-full h-full bg-[#00fff7]/50 rounded-lg flex justify-center items-center opacity-0 hover:opacity-100 transition">
    <img class="w-20 h-20" src="./images/icon-view.svg" alt="eye">
  </div>

  <div class="w-96">
    <img class="rounded-lg" src="./images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="">
  </div>
</div>
```
